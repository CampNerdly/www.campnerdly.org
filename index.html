		<h2>What is it?</h2>
		<p>
			Camp Nerdly is a gathering of old and new friends each year to play
			<strong>role-playing and board games</strong> and to experience
			nature. It runs from Friday afternoon to Sunday morning, and we
			play games together, cook meals in our mess hall, and hang out
			in cabins. It is inexpensive <strong>(~$65)</strong> and a great time!
		</p>
		<p>
		This year, Camp Nerdly will be held <strong>May 13-15, 2016</strong> in the
			<a href="http://www.nps.gov/prwi/">Prince William Forest Park</a> in
			Triangle, VA. It's about <strong>35 miles south of Washington, DC,</strong>
			and isn't a far drive for most of the East Coast. It's 4-5 hours from
			NYC, and 4 hours from the Triangle area of North Carolina. Here are
